## Project 1: Fed Funds Interest Rates

This project focuses on modeling and analysis of the Effective Federal Funds Rate, a pivotal interest rate in financial markets. The aim is to comprehend the factors influencing the rate and to construct precise prediction models.

### Steps:
- **Data preprocessing**: Removal of columns like Year, Month, and Day.
- **Feature scaling**: Using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
- **Train-test split**: Dividing data into train, test, and validation sets.
- **Feature importance analysis**: Using Random Forest Regressor to determine key factors.
- **Regression analysis**: Employing the OLS method with key variables.
- **Model evaluation**: Training and evaluating various regression models.
- **Model tuning**: Using grid search and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Best model selection**: Picking models with the highest R-squared scores.

## Project 2: Renewable Energy

As an in-house data scientist for a renewable energy firm, this project involves analyzing field data for wind turbines and building a predictive model for power generation.

### Objectives:
- Clean and prepare data for optimal model performance.
- Construct a machine learning model to predict power generation.
- Evaluate and fine-tune the model.
